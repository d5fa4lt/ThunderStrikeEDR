# ThunderStrike EDR 

![ThunderStrikeEDR Logo](image.png)

## Introduction
I create this project to Learn Edr Internals and Windows kernel Programming. 


## üöÄ Features
It only has one feature right now which is inject a Hook DLL into each process using KAPC.
I will add More Features in the future. 


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Caution 
This project is currently under active development. Features are experimental and may be unstable or incomplete. It is strongly recommended to run and test this EDR inside a virtual machine (VM) to avoid affecting your main system. Use at your own risk.


## üìù To-Do 

- Implement a memory scanner.
- Integrate basic logging and alerting system.
- Integrate ETW / ETW-TI
